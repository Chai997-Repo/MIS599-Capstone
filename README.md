## AI-Driven Analysis and Character Interaction System for Web Series

📋 Project Overview:
This project leverages state-of-the-art AI and NLP techniques to provide comprehensive analysis of web series content, including theme identification, character relationship mapping, sentiment analysis, and an interactive character chatbot system. The system enables researchers, viewers, and content creators to gain deep insights into narrative structures and character dynamics through automated analysis.
✨ Key Features

Theme Analysis: 
Automated extraction of main themes and sentiment trends using Large Language Models
Character Network Visualization: Interactive relationship mapping using Named Entity Recognition
Scene Classification: Custom text classifier for categorizing scenes by genre or emotional tone
Character Chatbot: Interactive dialogue system that emulates character personalities
User-Friendly Interface: Web interface built with Gradio for easy access to analysis results

🏗️ System Architecture:
The system consists of five core components:
Data Collection Module: Web scraping with Scrapy
Theme & Sentiment Analysis: LLM implementation with Hugging Face
Character Network Analysis: NER with SpaCy and visualization with NetworkX/PyViz
Custom Text Classification: Theme-based scene categorization
Interactive Chatbot: Character dialogue emulation system

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Scrapy: Web scraping framework for data collection
Hugging Face Transformers: LLM implementation for NLP tasks
SpaCy: Named Entity Recognition and text processing
NetworkX & PyViz: Network analysis and visualization
Gradio: Web interface development
DialogFlow/Rasa: (Optional) Chatbot framework alternative
